# LearnNode.js

Welcome to your Node.js learning journey! This README will guide you through getting started with Node.js and provide some resources to help you along the way.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to build scalable and high-performance web applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it well-suited for building real-time applications and APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start learning Node.js, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js**: Install Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). You can verify the installation by running `node -v` in your terminal.

- **Text Editor**: Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your preference. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

### Hello World Example

Let's create a simple "Hello World" example to ensure your Node.js installation is working correctly. 

1. Create a new folder for your Node.js projects.
2. Inside the folder, create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `hello.js`.

```javascript
// hello.js
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
